FIRE_PROTOCOL = """
You must follow standard firefighting doctrine:
1. Life safety is the top priority.
2. Identify fire type (vehicle, chemical, electrical).
3. Establish hot, warm, and cold zones.
4. Extinguish fire before any investigation.
5. Never prioritize evidence over active fire suppression.
